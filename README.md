# *The Little Schemer* Workbook

This repo is designed to be a nice way to work through *The Little Schemer*. You'll create a new file per chapter, add it to the table of contents (`toc.rkt`), and load your code into the [REPL][1] with `./schemer.sh`.

You'll need [Racket][2] and [Rlwrap][3] installed. Racket is a modern, Scheme-like language. Rlwrap is a readline wrapper that gives you command history, among other things. You can install them both with Homebrew.

    brew install racket
    brew install rlwrap
    ./schemer.sh
